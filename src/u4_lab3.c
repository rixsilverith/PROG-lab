// --> Lab exercise 3: Declare a structure that contains two members of 
// type integer. Write a program that uses that structure to ask the user
// to write two integers and save them in each of the members of the structure.
//
// The program has to check and inform if the numbers are even or odd.
//
// Note: This exercise corresponds to one of the weekly tests of continuous
// evaluation of past courses.
//
// The messages must be shown as they appear in the following execution
// examples and in the same order (varying only according to the data
// entered by the user).
//
// The following is an example of execution:
//
// ? Enter a number: 17
// ? Enter another number: 6
// --> The number 17 is odd and the number 6 is even.
//
// The following is another example of execution:
//
// ? Enter a number: 16
// ? Enter another number: 4
// --> The numbers 16 and 4 are even.
