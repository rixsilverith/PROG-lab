// PROG-lab. Week 2. U2: Basic data types and operators.
// --------------------------------------------------------
// --> Lab exercise 1: Write a program that requests two characters
// one by one. The program must add the ASCII code of both characters
// and show the result, including the ASCII code of each of them.
//
// The messages must be shown as they appear in the following example
// of execution and in the same order (varying only according to the
// data entered by the user).
//
// Note: This exercise corresponds to one of the weekly tests of
// continuous evaluation of past courses.
//
// The following is an example of program execution:
//
// ? Please, enter a character: A
// ? Please, enter another character: L
// --> If we add the ASCII code of the character A that is 65 with
// the ASCII code of the character L that is 76 we get the number 141.
