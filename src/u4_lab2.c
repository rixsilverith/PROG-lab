// PROG-lab. Week 4. U4: Constants, arrays, strings and structs
// - Lab exercises
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// --> Lab exercise 2: Declare a structure that contains three members of
// integer type. Write a program that uses that structure to ask the user
// to write three integers and save them in each member of the structure.
//
// The program has to check and inform if the three numbers are different,
// there are two equal or all three are equal.
//
// Note: Remember that only two variables can be compared at a time.
// Note: This exercise corresponds to one of the weekly tests of continuous
// evaluation of past courses.
//
// The messages must be shown as they appear in the following execution
// examples and in the same order (varying only according to the data entered
// by the user).
//
// The following is an example of program execution:
//
// ? Enter the first number: 17
// ? Enter the second number: 6
// ? Enter the third number: 20
// --> The three numbers are different.
//
// The following is another example of program execution:
//
// ? Enter the first number: 17
// ? Enter the second number: 6
// ? Enter the third number: 17
// --> There are two identical numbers and one different.
