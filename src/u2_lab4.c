// PROG-lab. Week 2. U2: Basic data types and operators. - Lab
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// --> Lab exercise 4: Write a program that asks for a number between 1
// and 5 and a character. The program must encrypt the character by
// adding the value of the entered number. As a result, you must show the
// original character and its ASCII code along with the encrypted character
// and its ASCII code.
//
// You can assume that the user will always enter a number between 1 and 5.
// The messages must be shown as they appear in the following example of
// execution and in the same order (varying only according to the data
// entered by the user).
//
// Note: This exercise corresponds to one of the weekly tests of continuous
// evaluation of past courses.
//
// The following is an example of execution:
//
// ? Enter a number between 1 and 5: 3
// ? Enter a character: C
//
// --> The character 'C' with ASCII code 67, if it is encrypted with the 
// number 3, would become the character 'F' with the ASCII code 70.
