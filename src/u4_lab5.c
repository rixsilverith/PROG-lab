// PROG-lab. Week 4. U4: Constants, arrays, strings and structs
// - Lab exercises
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// --> Lab exercise 5: Define a structure called Person that contains a 
// string for the name and an integer for his age. Define another structure
// called People that contains a table of two elements of type Person and
// a variable of type double to store the average of their ages.
//
// Write a program that declares a variable of type People. The program has 
// to request the name and an age and store them in the first position of 
// the array. Next, it will request another name and another age and it will
// store them in the second position of the array. It will continue calculating
// the average of both ages and keeping it in the double member of the structure.
// Finally, it will show the name of both people, their ages and the avarage of
// both ages with one decimal.
//
// The program has to use macros to define the sizes of the strings and arrays.
//
// Note: This exercise corresponds to one of the weekly tests of continuous
// evaluation of a past year.
//
// The messages must be shown as they appear in the following example of 
// execution and in the same order (varying only according to the data entered
// by the user).
//
// The following is an example of program execution:
//
// ? First Name: Mario
// ? Age: 18
// ? Second Name: MarÃ­a
// ? Age: 19
// --> Mario is 18 years old and MarÃ­a is 19 years old.
// --> The age mean is 18.5 years.
