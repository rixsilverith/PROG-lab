// ------------------------------------------------------------
// --> Lab exercise 2: Write a program that asks for two initials of
// two people and their heights in cm and calculate the ideal weight
// and average of the ideal weights according to the Lorentz formula.
// The Lorentz formula is the following:
//
// weight = height - 100 - (height - 150) / 4
//
// The messages must be shown as they appear in the following example
// of execution and in the same order (varying only according to the
// data entered by the user).
//
// Note: This exercise corresponds to one of the weekly tests of
// continuous evaluation of past courses.
//
// The following is an example of execution:
//
// ? Enter the initial of the first person: P
// ? Enter the height of the first person: 176.5
// ? Enter the initial of the second person: L
// ? Enter the height of the second person: 180
// 
// --> The ideal weight of P is 69.9 kg.
// --> The ideal weight of L is 72.5 kg.
// --> The average of both ideal weights is 71.2 kg.
