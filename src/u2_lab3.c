// ------------------------------------------------------------
// --> Lab exercise 3: Write a program that asks for a height in cm,
// an age in years and the initial of a name. The program must 
// calculate the ideal weight according to the Perroult formula.
// According to this author, the ideal weight is calcualted as follows:
//
// weight = height - 100 + (9 * age) / 100.0
//
// The height can be a number with decimals. The age will be a whole
// number. use three decimals to show the weight and one to show the
// height. The messages must be shown as they appear in the following
// example of execution and in the same order (varying only according
// to the data entered by the user).
//
// Note: This exercise corresponds to one of the weekly tests of continous
// evalaution of past courses.
//
// The following is an example of program execution:
//
// ? Enter the height in cm: 175.5
// ? Enter the age in years: 18
// ? Finally, enter the initial of the name: C
//
// --> The ideal weight of C, who measures 175.5 cm and is 18 years old,
// is 77,120 kg.
