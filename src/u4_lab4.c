// --> Lab exercise 4: The program you must write needs a type of structured
// data that contains three members of integer type. The program must declare
// a variable of this type and request the user three integers, which must be
// stored in the members of the structure.
//
// The program must inform which is the smallest of the three numbers.
//
// Note: This exercise corresponds to one of the weekly tests of continuous
// evaluation of past courses.
//
// The messages must be shown as they appear in the following execution examples
// and in the same order (varying only due to the data entered by the user).
//
// The following is an example of execution:
//
// ? Enter the first number: 17
// ? Enter the second number: 6
// ? Enter the third number: 8
// --> The number 6 is the smallest
